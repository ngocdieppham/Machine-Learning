# Machine-Learning
  ## Introduction
This project aims at my studying the fundamentals of Machine Learning in python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in the second edition of O'Reilly book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow.
Its goal is to give the concepts, tools that need to implement programs capable of learning from data. It will be using production-ready Python framework: Scikit-Learn
