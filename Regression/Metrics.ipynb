    "The general problem supervised machine learning seeks to solve is to map a measurement of several variables to a target value or class. For example, we might use supervised machine learning to transcribe spoken language to text, predict home values based on neighborhood amenities, or detect fraudulent transactions. In order to assess whether our model is succeeding, we need to formally define what success is for the given task. In this notebook, we will explore several common **metrics** for model performance."

    "When we design a model to predict real number values (e.g. home price), our model is a **regression model**. Alternatively, we could design a model to predict categorical labels, such as \"expensive neighborhood\" and \"inexpensive neighborhood\". This would be a **classification model**. Most supervised machine learning tasks fall into the category of **regression** or **classification**. In either case we have to define a metric that quantifies what we mean by $\\approx$ in the equation above.\n",

    "## Metrics for regression tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [notebook on linear regression](ML_LinearRegression.ipynb) we introduced mean squared error (MSE) as a metric for how our trend line was performing. This lead us to define a cost function, a scalar function that depends on our model parameters. We minimized the cost function using gradient descent. Depending on what problem we are trying to solve and what we want to optimize, we may choose different metrics.\n",

    "**Mean squared error** (MSE) is one of the most common metrics for regression:\n",

    "$$ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i\\left[f(X_i) - y_i\\right]^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We squared the error terms ($f(X_i) - y_i$) because we didn't care whether they were positive or negative. We could have also addressed this concern by taking the absolute value, which would lead to the **mean absolute error** (MAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_i|f(X_i) - y_i| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When we minimize the MAE by adjusting our model parameters, our model will be less strongly affected by outliers than if we used the MSE. This is because the error terms from outliers (which will generally be large) enter into the MAE a linear terms rather than being squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common metric for regression is $R^2$, also known as the **coefficient of determination**. The $R^2$ quantifies how our model's MSE compares to a naive model in which we always predict the mean $y$ value, $\\bar{y}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "The metrics for regression rely on calculating an error term (i.e. the difference between our prediction and the ground truth). We can't do this for a classification task, so we will need to define entirely different metrics for classification. Let's start with the possible outcomes when we make a prediction.\n",

    "Accuracy suffers from tasks in which there is class imbalance. For instance, in fraud detection, actual positives are very rare. Therefore, we could get high accuracy by simply always predicting negative. If only 0.1% of all observations are actually positive, then a model that always predicts negative gets 99.9% accuracy, even though this is clearly a bad model for detecting fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example illustrates that we often care about one class more than another. For instance, if we think a transaction is fraudulent, we might waste some resources investigating it, but missing a case of fraud could cost much more. In this case we might want most to avoid false negatives.\n",

    "**Recall** is the count of true positives divided by the count of _actual positives_. Recall will be close to 1 as long as the count of false negatives is low, even if there are not many actual positives.\n",

    "On the other hand, if a fraud case goes to trial, we do not want to punish a defendant unfairly. In that case it's important to avoid false positives. **Precision** is the count of true positives divided by the count of positive predictions. As long as the count of false positives is low, precision will be close to 1."

    "Often our classification model won't predict whether an observation is in one class or another, but rather will predict the _probability_ of the observation being in one class or the other.

If our model were perfect, precision and recall would both be 1 regardless of threshold, so the area under the curve would be 1. If our model was always wrong, the precision and recall would both be 0 regardless of threshold, so the area under the curve would be 0. The better our model is, _regardless of threshold_, the closer the area under the curve is to 1. We eventually need to a choose a threshold and may choose to prioritize precision or recall, but the **area under the precision-recall curve** (AUC), is a very useful metric for assessing model performance in classification tasks."
