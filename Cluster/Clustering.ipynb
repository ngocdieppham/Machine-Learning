    "# Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a branch of unsupervised machine learning where the goal is to identify groups or clusters in your data set without the use of labels. Clustering should not be considered the same as classification; we are not trying make predictions on observations from a set of classes. In clustering, you are identifying a set of similar data points and calling the resulting set a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example of clustering. You may have a data set characterizing your customers like demographic information and personal preferences. A supervised machine learning application would be to determine whether a person will buy a product. However, an unsupervised machine learning application would be to identify several groups or types of customers. With these groups identified, you can analyze the groups and build profiles describing the groups. For example, one group tends to include people from the ages 20 to 25 who like the outdoors. With these profiles, you can pass that information and analysis to the marketing team to create different advertisements to best attract each group."
