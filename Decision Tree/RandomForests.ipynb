    "Random Forest is an ensemble of Decision Trees, trained via the bagging method (or somtimes pasting), with max_samples set to the size of training set. Instead of building a BaggingClassifier and passing it a DecisionTreeClassifier, we can use RandomForestClassifier class (or RandomForestRegressor for regression tasks), which is more convenient and optimezed for Decision Trees. The following code is to train a Random Forest classifier with 500 trees (each limited to maximum 16 nodes):"

    "A forest of such extremely random tree is called Extremely Randomized Trees (Extra-Trees for short). This technique trades higher bias for lower variance. It also makes Extra-Trees much faster to train than regular Random Forest, because finding the best possible threshold for each feature at every node is one of the most time-consuming tasks of growing a tree\n",

Scikit-Learn measure a feature's important by looking at how much the tree nodes that use the feature reduce impurity on average (across all trees in the forest). More precisely, it is a weighted average, where each node's weight is equal to the number of training samples that are associated with it\n",
